At Boys State, participants learn the rights, privileges and responsibilities of franchised citizens. The training is objective and centers on the structure of city, county, and state governments operated by students elected to various offices. Instruction will also be presented on the law and court system, parliamentary procedure, and Florida political History. Citizens will gain hands-on experience to leadership by taking part in the political process through role-play civic exercises.

Two citizens from each Girls State are selected to participate in the annual Girls Nation program.
